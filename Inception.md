# Request for Information (RFI): Analysis of Inception

**To:** [Threat Intelligence Analyst's Name]  
**From:** Egidijus Galginas  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Subject:** Request for Intelligence on Inception Group

## Key Information Request:

### Overview of Inception Group:
   - **Recent Activities**: Inception Group has been observed targeting governmental and financial sectors, particularly in Europe and Central Asia, with highly customized multi-stage attacks.
   - **Motivations**: Primarily espionage, with an emphasis on gaining access to sensitive government and financial information.
   - **Attribution**: Moderate confidence attribution to Russian-speaking operators with suspected state alignment.

### Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs):
   - **Current TTPs**:
     - **Modular Malware**: Employs VBS-based backdoors and modularized malware for adaptability.
     - **Cloud-based C2 Infrastructure** to evade detection and simplify scaling.
     - **Spear-Phishing and Exploit Kits**: Common initial access vectors.
   - **Evolving Techniques**: Increased use of cloud services for C2 operations, making detection and attribution challenging.

### Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):
   - **Current IOCs**:
     - IP Addresses: `203.0.113.5`, `198.51.100.7`
     - Domains: `cloud-comm[.]net`, `gov-secure[.]org`
     - File Hashes: `6dcd4ce23d88e2ee9568ba546c007c63`
     - Malware Signatures: VBScript-based backdoor signatures.
   - **Immediate IOCs to Integrate**: Prioritize blocking access to `cloud-comm[.]net` and monitoring VBScript activity.

### Vulnerabilities and Exploits:
   - **Known Vulnerabilities**: CVE-2020-0601 (Windows CryptoAPI Spoofing), CVE-2021-34527 (PrintNightmare), both commonly exploited.
   - **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities**: No known active zero-days; however, adaptive use of patchable vulnerabilities remains a concern.

### Recent Campaigns and Operations:
   - **Recent Campaigns**: Recent campaigns have been observed focusing on regional banks and government contractors.
   - **Geopolitical Alignment**: There is a potential alignment with regional geopolitical interests in Central Asia and Eastern Europe, correlating with political developments.

## Additional Context and Questions:
- **Attack Surface**: Given the organization's infrastructure, risks include cloud-based C2 bypassing traditional firewalls.
  
- **Recommendations**: Implement advanced endpoint monitoring, restrict cloud services traffic, and monitor for VBScript activity.
