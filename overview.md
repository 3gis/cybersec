# Overview of Relevant APT Groups

### Overview of Relevant APT Groups:
   - **Active APT Groups**: APT16, Inception, and Tropic Trooper have shown recent activity targeting government, media, and financial sectors.
   - **Motivations**: Predominantly espionage, with APT16 and Tropic Trooper having political motivations, while Inception is economically driven.
   - **Attribution Confidence**: Attribution links APT16 and Tropic Trooper to Chinese state interests, while Inception Group is likely Russian-speaking with state support.
   - **Common TTPs**: Phishing, custom malware, and exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

### Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs):
   - **Current TTPs**: Use of phishing, custom backdoors, and leveraging cloud infrastructure for evasion.
   - **Evolving TTPs**: Increased complexity in multi-stage attacks and adaptable infrastructure, especially for Inception.

### Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):
   - **Current IOCs**: See individual files for specific IOCs across IPs, domains, and malware hashes.
   - **Critical IOCs for Integration**: High-priority IOCs across groups include IPs and domains associated with their cloud C2 infrastructure.

### Vulnerabilities and Exploits:
   - **Common Vulnerabilities**: CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2020-0601, CVE-2017-11882 are commonly exploited.
   - **Zero-Day Activity**: Currently no active zero-days, but increased focus on unpatched vulnerabilities.

### Geopolitical and Strategic Impacts:
   - **Geopolitical Events**: Chinese regional interests impact APT16 and Tropic Trooper, while Russian-related political shifts influence Inception.
   - **Impact of Tensions**: Heightened targeting expected in APAC for APT16 and Tropic Trooper; potential for European targets by Inception.

## Additional Context and Questions:
- **Attack Surface**: Outdated software and cloud infrastructures present risks across groups.
  
- **Recommendations**: Increased monitoring of cloud services traffic, application patching, and phishing defense.
